    subtitle: "Uniting 15 villages through the spirit of cricket",
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-..."
  },

import hero1 from '../assets/images/hero/hero-1.jpg';
import hero2 from '../assets/images/hero/hero-2.jpg';
import hero3 from '../assets/images/hero/hero-3.jpg';

const heroSlides = [

    image: hero1
  },
  {

import scoringImg from '../assets/images/features/scoring.jpg';
